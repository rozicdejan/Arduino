__________________
The â€™HC595 devices contain an 8-bit serial-in, parallel-out
shift register that feeds an 8-bit D-type storage register. The storage register has parallel 3-state outputs.
Separate clocks are provided for both the shift and storage register. The shift register has a direct
overriding clear (SRCLR) input, serial (SER) input, and serial outputs for cascading.

When the output-enable (OE) input is high, the outputs are in the high-impedance state. Both the shift register clock (SRCLK) and storage register clock (RCLK) are positive-edge triggered.

If both clocks are connected together, the shift register always is one clock pulse ahead of the storage register
